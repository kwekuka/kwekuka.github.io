## About Me

I am a PhD Candidate at Brown University where I am advised by Seny Kamara. Broadly, I research machine learning and automated decision making with the goal of ensuring that these techniques are both responsible and trustworthy. 

## Research Interests

Machine Learning, Algorithmic Fairness, Adversarial Learning, Optimal Transport

## Ongoing Projects 
- **Measuring Fairness when Protected Groups are Unkown** 
<br> _with Naveen Durvasula and John Dickerson__
<br> Accessing and characterizing the accuracy of fairness metrics, in the common scenario where protected attributes are difficult or impossible to obtain.    
  
  
- **Interactive Proofs for Verifying Machine Learning Computations** 
<br> *with Seny Kamara* 
<br> We are developing efficient protocols for verifying machine learning computations, when the prover (the party under audit) is adversarial or not fully trusted. 
  
- **Revisiting Area Under the Curve (AUC) for Model Selection**
<br> *with Suresh Venkatasubramanian, Marissa Gerchick Aaron Horowitz* 
<br>  In this work we highlight issues with common practice of validing risk assessment models with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric.
