## About Me

I am a PhD Candidate at Brown University where I am advised by Seny Kamara, and research fellow at Arthur AI. Broadly, I research machine learning and automated decision making with the goal of ensuring that these techniques are both responsible and trustworthy. 

Before this, I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Maryland - College Park, where I worked with John Dickerson and graduated in 2019.
