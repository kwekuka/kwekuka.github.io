## About Me

I am a PhD Candidate at Brown University where I am advised by Seny Kamara. Broadly, I research machine learning and au- tomated decision making with the goal of ensuring that these techniques are both responsible and trustworthy. 

## Research Interests

Machine Learning, Algorithmic Fairness, Adversarial Learning, Optimal Transport

## Ongoing Projects 
- **Measuring Fairness when Protected Groups are Unkown** 
<br> with Naveen Durvasula and John Dickerson 
<br> Accessing and characterizing the accuracy of fairness metrics, in the common scenario where protected attributes are difficult or impossible to obtain.    
  
<!--
  \item \textbf{Interactive Proofs for Verifying Machine Learning Computations} with Seny Kamara.  
            
  We are developing efficient protocols for verifying machine learning computations, when the prover (the party under audit) is adversarial or not fully trusted. 
  
  \item \textbf{Revisiting Area Under the Curve (AUC) for Model Selection } with Suresh Venkatasubramanian and Aaron Horowitz.  
  
  Across many disciplines, AUC is often used as a measurement to help validate risk assessment models.  In this work we show that as a model validation metric, AUC can often obfuscate important aspects of model performance, therefore leading to the erroneous validation of models which may have disparate impact across protected groups.
