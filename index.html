        <p> <b>About Me</b><br> I am computer scientist interested in bias, audit, and verifiability in machine learning. Currently, I am a 2nd year PhD student in Computer Science at Brown University in the <a href="http://esl.cs.brown.edu/">Encrypted Systems Lab</a> where I am advised by <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~seny/">Seny Kamara</a>. Previously, I was an undergrad at the University of Maryland in College Park, where I worked with <a href="http://jpdickerson.com/">John Dickerson</a>.<p>
        
         Mostly, my work falls at intersection of machine learning and theory. I am interested in questions which examine and critque data-driven technological solutionism: <em>when does it make sense to use machine learning, and when can the technology do harm?</em><br> 
            
        <p><b>Research</b><br>Lately my research has been focused on understanding the efficacy of machine learning in achieving fair and equitable outcomes for underrepresented and marginalized groups. With the use of Optimal Transport, I am working to develop better measurements of equity and fairness, as well as better algorithms for the detection of bias. <p>

    <p><b>Music<br></b>
        In my free time, I also like to play and study music. Recently, I was featured in a work entitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSm-9OBHtMg">"Pass Me Not"</a> - a segment focusing on examining the African Diaspora through song and dance as a part of Brown Art's Iniative ongoing series entitled "Remaking the Real." You can also catch me <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1omzpmIH0zoaxZrl3zxcXR1R5qONZkteJ/view?usp=sharing">playing jazz</a> in and around the Providence area.
